# Deployments, ReplicaSets and Services

These are all type of controllers. 

****Benefits of Controllers***
- Application reliability: where multiple instances of an application running, prevent problems if one or more instance fails.
- Scaling: when your pods experience a high volume of requests, kubernetes allows you to scale up your pods, allowing for a better user experience. 
- Load balancing: where having multiple versionsof a pod running allow traffic to flow to different pods, and doesnt overload a single pod or node
